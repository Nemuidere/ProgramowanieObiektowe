Venom.
Blight surrounding, Evil found me
Bleeding from the wounds.

Phony.
I just can’t see the simple things I can’t keep
What am I supposed to be?

Shoujo A.
Ah, this is just, how I dreamed...
Or it seems to be but...

Responsible Society.
Thinking of random things from time so long ago
Can't find the meaning in people I'll never know

Mesmerizer.
You're tailor-made for this day and age
Cuz' you're powerless and look like prey---~~

Tetoris.
Even if I start to care,
I can't help but feel that all of this is meaningless

Readymade.
Hurts, right? Hurts. Right?
If it gets me by, I'm fine
